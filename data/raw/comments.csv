39,"Answer is at least a, b, c and could include d, depending on how you define manage. Yes 3x replication ensures fault tolerance but it also allows parallel execution of jobs to be placed on the same node where a block of data resides. The locality benefit can provide faster data analysis and efficient cluster management depending on the workloads."
40,Thank you so much we want this kind of teachers

48,"Big Data is not unstructured data as you might have suggested in the beginning. Big Data is around big data sets that are otherwise too large to deal with. Big Data might be generated by a particle accelerator, for example, it will be structured data but will be considered as 'Big Data'. By the way, this term is not commonly used by Data professionals. It's mostly used by managers and marketing people."
